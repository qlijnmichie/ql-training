# Docker Resources - Beginners

What is Docker? The short (technical-sounding) version is that Docker is virtualization software that enables creating "containers" that can build, run, stop, and compose different, virtualized services.

That sounds scary, I'm sure, but Docker's not so bad once you start using it. It may be easier to start with what a Virtual Machine is. If you don't already know, a Virtual Machine allows one operating system to run inside another by having software on the host system provide fake ("virtualized") hardware for the OS that will run within it.

That may not be the best way to describe it, but you can learn more by reading this article: [Docker vs Virtual Machine â€“ Key Differences You Should Know](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/docker-vs-vm-key-differences-you-should-know/).

After, you can watch [Docker Tutorial for Beginners](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTFZFxd4hOI) to get a solid introduction on what Docker is and how you can begin using it.

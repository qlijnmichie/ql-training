# MySQL Resources - Beginners
Start by watching [Learn SQL in 23 Easy Steps](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cz3WcZLRaWc) for a quick overview of SQL in general, as well as to get MySQL and Visual Studio Code installed and setup.

> _NOTE:_ The video has you install `SQL Tools`, but you will first need to install `mtxr.sqltools-driver-mysql` (enter this text as a search in the Extensions tab search bar).

In case this installation process does not work for your OS or setup, see the official info for [installing MySQL](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-installation-excerpt/5.7/en/) and [installing Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download).


After following this video, go through the following exercies and test out ad solidify your new SQL skills:
- MySQL exercises from W3 (in-browser practice) here: https://www.w3schools.com/mysql/exercise.asp
- MySQL practice problems (complete using your MySQL database and VS Code) here: https://stackhowto.com/mysql-practice-exercises-with-solutions-part-1/
    - There's a file you can download apparently, but I have techs re-create the table schema/data the practice exercises use for additional practice.
